Education - Kids
====

Due to COVID we currently are not offering any kids classes, please sign up for our [newsletter](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdTljdTP-yQvY3iFS5zxmPI5YIAh7POdXYN3GM0COKb3SHTnw/viewform) to be notified when registration begins.

To start learning on your own, we recommend trying [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), a free, online, community-supported game development platform. If you need help getting started, feel free to [send us a note](mailt:education@louisvillemakesgames.org).
