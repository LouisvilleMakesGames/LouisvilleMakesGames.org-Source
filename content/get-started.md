Louisville Makes Games!
-----------------------

### An Organization

The goal of Louisville Makes Games! is to promote game development as a viable career in our city through game development programming classes for kids, industry talks, art gallery showcases and other events. We educate and advocate game development. Our first major project was establishing the physical space called Warp Zone Louisville downtown, which we hope to make home-base for all things game development in Louisville.

### A Space

Warp Zone Louisville is Louisville's first, and only, game developer co-working space. Monthly paying members have full 24-hour access to collaborative workspace and the ability to host their own events such as meetups, game launches, and more! Warp Zone is also the space used by the non-profit Louisville Makes Games! for their education program and the GameDevLou meetup.

A Community
-----------

A twice monthly meetup to connect local developers. Since January 2014, Our community has consistently grown in number of creative individuals and in diversity. The Louisville Game Creator's meetup is a twice-monthly support group and socializing event for game developers of all skill levels to share ideas, be encouraging, and inspire one another. It will always be free and open to anyone interested in creativity and collaboration. [Find the next meeting.](https://www.meetup.com/LouisvilleMakesGames/)How do I get started making games?

### A guide by Louisville Makes Games! Community members

We have two recommended paths for beginners one is to attend a game jam, and the other is to start with a tutorial in an existing game engine.

Path 1: Game Jams
-----------------

### What is a game jam?

A game jam is a (usually) weekend long event where you get a theme, form a team, and create a game based on the theme. The great thing about game jams is you can be an absolute beginner, and whether you are interested in art, code, music, story, or game design you can up your skills and pick up a lot from your team members. While many people up their skills by reading online reviews (such as these [bingo cash reviews](https://www.gistrat.com/kill-time-and-earn-some-cash-with-these-9-tips/)) and making changes to already existing games, some people try to make a game from scratch.

Even if you think you have nothing to give to the team, you can usually work with people who have made games before and help with various tasks until you are up to speed and contributing. Furthermore, you can continually improve your creativity when it comes to color palettes, UIs of games, and game response. Take inspiration from online casino sites (like [oxi.casino](https://www.oxi.casino/en-au/live/roulette)) and observe how they are able to handle a large number of players at one time, how user-friendly their website is, and how many different types of games they offer. It may enhance your knowledge of developing multiplayer games, which you can share with other participants in the jam. There are 3 game jams Louisville Makes Games! does in person each year, Global Game Jam, Ludum Dare, and Kentucky Fried Pixels, check our events on meetup(link) to find out when the next one is and join in. Here is a video that explains game jams a lot better, it's a keynote for the 2017 Global Game Jam: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xfxx27HbM4>

Path 2: Start with an existing engine and tutorial
--------------------------------------------------

### What should I make games with?

This may sound daunting, but it doesn't matter what engine you make games with. If you have a reliable internet connection (like those provided by [ATT internet](https://www.highspeedoptions.com/providers/att) service providers) and a computer, it is super simple to find something that works for you! A good starting point for making games, in general, is Construct, a 2D game creation program that works inside your web browser. It has a huge community built up around it and tons of great tutorials to help you get started on your game-making quest! With Construct, you don't have to write any code to create a game and can use some drag-and-drop tools and simple logic to piece together something of your own. For now, you just need to get started. Who knows, maybe you'll start making sophisticated and interesting games like Diablo II and gamers might look around for your game's [stone of jordan](https://www.yesgamers.com/diablo-2/the-stone-of-jordan) (Diablo II reference). Game making isn't as complicated as you might think. And also, Construct 3's web interface has links to tutorials built right into the browser window that you can follow along with while you work.

<https://www.construct.net> <https://www.scirra.com/tutorials/37/beginners-guide-to-construct-2> With its simple tools to build games using only drag and drop, you can have small games up and running in no time! Unfortunately, for the free version of Construct, there are limitations, such as a hard limit of 100 events (while Construct 3 is in beta, the engine is completely free with no limitations).

Tutorials:
----------

Construct3 comes with built-in tutorials (Visual Programming) <https://www.construct.net> Unity's official site has some great tutorials (Some programming knowledge required) <https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials> I'd recommend getting started with the "Roll-a-ball" tutorial!

Unreal Engine <https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Videos/> Make a platformer in Phaser (JavaScript) <https://mozdevs.github.io/html5-games-workshop/en/guides/platformer/start-here/>
