### Louisville Makes Games! Organization
--------------------

Louisville Makes Games is run as a non-profit 501(c)3 organization. The goal of LMG is to promote game development as a viable career in our city through game development programming classes for kids, industry talks, art gallery showcases and other events. We educate and advocate game development. Our first major project was establishing the physical space called Warp Zone Louisville downtown, which we have made a home-base for all things game development in Louisville.
