   <h1>Game Jams</h1>
   <p><strong>What is a game jam?</strong></p>
   <p>A game jam is a weekend-long event where you can join a team and create a brand new game based on a theme. It's a great way for beginners to learn about game development in a supportive and inclusive environment. Whether you want to do art, animation, storytelling, programming, music, or sound effects –
      you will be in the right place! The LMG community hosts 2-3 game jams a year, including <a href="https://globalgamejam.org/" target="_blank">Global Game Jam</a>, <a href="https://ldjam.com/" target="_blank">Ludum Dare</a>, and our own creation "Kentucky Fried Pixels". Join our <a href="https://discord.gg/a9rDtTWXAp" target="_blank">Discord server</a> and our <a href="https://www.meetup.com/louisvillemakesgames/" target="_blank">Meetup group</a> to get news on upcoming events.

   <h1>Picking an Engine</h1>
   <p>Getting started in game development can be overwhelming, especially with the multitude of game engines available. It can be tempting to spend time researching and comparing engines before starting to work on a project, but this is often counterproductive. The truth is, it is much more important to simply pick an engine and get started. Many facets of game creation carry over from engine to engine so even if this first one is not your second, the skills you learn will still be very valuable!</p>
   <p><strong>Start Simple</strong></p>
   <p>It's important to start with something simple, like getting a box moving with keyboard keys, rather than trying to create your dream MMORPG game from the start. This allows you to learn the basics of game development and become familiar with your chosen engine. It's essential to focus on getting started and building your skills, rather than trying to create a masterpiece right away.</p>
   <p><strong>Pick a Supported Engine</strong></p>
   <p>Picking a game engine that has an active and supportive community is important for everyone, but especially beginners. Thankfully, our local game development community regularly uses popular engines such as <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a>, <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a>, <a href="https://twinery.org/">Twine</a>, <a href="https://love2d.org/">Love</a>, and <a href="https://libgdx.com/">LibGDX</a>. This means that not only will you have access to the wealth of online resources and tutorials, but you can always ask folks in our community for help.</p>
   </p>
   <p><strong>Start with Official Tutorials</strong></p>
   <p>One of the best ways to get started is to find an official tutorial for your chosen engine. Following a tutorial will give you a basic understanding of how to use the engine, and you can then modify the game or start something new. This can give you the confidence you need to start your own project and continue learning as you go.
   </p>
   <p><strong>Don't Hesitate to Ask for Help</strong></p>
   <p>From our experience the game development community is friendly, inclusive, and encouraging, we strive to be that way in our local Louisville community as well. Our <a href="https://discord.gg/a9rDtTWXAp">Discord server</a> is a great resource, and people are always willing to help. You can get feedback on your project, ask for technical help, or simply chat with other game developers. Remember, everyone starts somewhere, and there is always something new to learn.
   </p>
   <p>In conclusion, it is much more important to get started with any game engine than to worry about which engine to choose. Starting with a simple project, choosing a supported engine, following official tutorials, and asking for help are all key steps to make your game development journey fun and rewarding. Don't let analysis paralysis hold you back - pick an engine and start creating today!</p>
