# Louisville Makes Games

New website for 2023!


This is a static site build with a simple generator.

## Prereqs

1. Install node 
2. Navigate to the root of this project in your terminal
3. run `npm i` to install the node modules used by the project


## To build:

1. Navigate to the root of this project in your terminal
2. Run `npm start` from the terminal, then files will magically appear in the `dest` folder.


### To preview it

1. Run `npm run serve` and it will do a python thing and let you view the site at port 8000


### Now you need to get those files onto a server.

1. 'npm run upload'
